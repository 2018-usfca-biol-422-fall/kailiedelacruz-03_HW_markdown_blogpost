In America today, the general population is reliant on technology. It can be used as a form of entertainment, to answer any random questions we may have and even to conduct complicated research. Three very common forms of technology include Windows, MacOS and Linux. The details expressed in this article, speaking to these everyday operating systems, are to inform the general public, especially college students. These details include:

* the history of the three operating systems
* their strengths and weaknesses
* their marketshare
* their use in different communities
* their interfaces

In an article titled ["The History of Windows Operating Systems"](https://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Hardware_Software/history_of_microsoft_windows_operating_system.html), Vangie Beal said:

This family of operating systems, containing nine versions, was started in the year 1985 and continues to be prevalent til today. In the article titled ["From Windows 1 to Windows 10:29 years of Windows evolution"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/from-windows-1-to-windows-10-29-years-of-windows-evolution), Samuel Gibbs speaks to how Windows 1, the first of nine versions, was birthed by Bill Gates.
