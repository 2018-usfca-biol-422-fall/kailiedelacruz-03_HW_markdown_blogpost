In America today, the general population is reliant on technology. It can be used as a form of entertainment, to answer any random questions we may have and even to conduct complicated research. Three very common forms of technology include Windows, MacOS and Linux. The details expressed in this article, speaking to these everyday operating systems, are to inform the general public, especially college students. These details include:

* the history of the three operating systems
* their strengths and weaknesses
* their marketshare
* their use in different communities
* their interfaces

**Windows**

In an article titled ["The History of Windows Operating Systems"](https://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Hardware_Software/history_of_microsoft_windows_operating_system.html), Vangie Beal said:

> The Windows operating system (Windows OS) for desktop PCs are more formally called Microsoft Windows and is actually a family of operating systems for personal computers

This family of operating systems, containing nine versions, was started in the year 1985 and continues to be prevalent til today. In the article titled ["From Windows 1 to Windows 10:29 years of Windows evolution"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/from-windows-1-to-windows-10-29-years-of-windows-evolution), Samuel Gibbs speaks to how Windows 1, the first of nine versions, was birthed by Bill Gates.

With Bill Gates' development of Windows 1, overtime, the operating systems continued to be helpful to the society. According to Candice Brien in ["Strengths and Weaknesses of Different Operating Systems,"](https://candicebrien.wordpress.com/2015/05/24/strengths-and-weaknesses-of-different-operating-systems/), the advantages include:

* its easy use
  * the presentation is generally the same
* utilities, software and games are available for users
  * Ex: Microsoft Office is widely used

 However, Brien also talks about the downfalls of these operating systems such as:

* the utilities provided can be quite expensive
  * Microsoft Office, though widely used, comes with a fee

  With this information, such drawbacks can be the cause of the marketshare statistics seen over time for Windows. Seen in this graph titled ["Global operating systems market share for desktop PCs, from January 2013 to July 2018"](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218089/global-market-share-of-windows-7/), you are able to see how there is a very slight decrease in the market share over the past five years. Regardless of this, in different communities, the operating systems are used for a variety of things. According to Microsoft Window's Essential Guide titled ["Microsoft Ignite 2018 conference coverage"](https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/Windows), Margaret Rouse says:
>Microsoft makes its consumer operating systems for users in an ordinary household setting...Microsoft designed Windows 10 Home for consumers and tailored to operate on PCs, tablets and 2-in-1 devices. Microsoft built Windows 10 Pro as a baseline OS for any business, while it developed Windows 10 Enterprise for businesses with higher security needs.

Fortunately, Windows can be used in many different environments. With the help of the operating system's graphical user interface, which allows users to communicate with their computers with windows, icons and menus, this is made easier.

**MacOS**

MacOS, was developed by the computer company that goes by the name of Apple Inc, which was founded by Steve Jobs, Ronald Wayne and Steve Wozniak. While Windows operating system was developed in 1985, MacOS was started one year earlier in 1984.

According to ["Advantages and disadvantages of macOS"](http://www.versiondaily.com/advantages-disadvantages-mac-os-x/), Kristoffer Bonheur, writes how even though Windows is currently the most popular operating system, MacOS is gaining more credit. This may be due to the many advantages that come with MacOS, such as:

* it is very simple to use
* very few viruses and security issues
* easy to multitask
* preloaded productivity apps are associated with it
* works well with other Apple products

With benefits though, there are always drawbacks. These disadvantages include:

* Mac products are very expensive
* hardware upgrades can be difficult
* in competition with Windows for games and other applications

Even with the disadvantages, we can relate this back to the marketshare of MacOS, increasing over time. This can be seen in the same graph mentioned earlier titled ["Global operating systems market share for desktop PCs, from January 2013 to July 2018"](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218089/global-market-share-of-windows-7/). Like mentioned before, even though Windows is the most popular operating system in the world, MacOS is starting to make a name for itself. In further detail, another reason for this may be because it can be used among different communities. Specifically, according to Lucy Hattersley in ["Why programmers think Mac OS is the best operating system to use"](https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/why-programmers-think-mac-os-x-is-best-os-use-3638706/), if you were to attend a technology conference, you can easily see 98% of the audience with a MacBook. Along with this though, MacOS is used among many people, especially college students. Speaking from experience, almost every one of my peers uses an Apple laptop. The fact that the MacOS uses a graphical user interface, it is much easier to use.

**Linux**

In ["What is Linux?"](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/what-is-linux/), the author shares how the Linux operating system was founded by someone named Linus Torvalds. He began the project in 1991, and after a couple of years of working on it with the help of other developers, the first version of Linux was officially developed in 1994.

In speaking about the advantages of Linux, Jennifer Mash, in the article ["Linux: Advantages and Disadvantages of Open-Source Technology"](https://blog.storagecraft.com/linux-advantages-disadvantages-open-source-technology/) includes points such as:

* it is open-source, which means that the original code is available to anyone and can be modified
* there is increased security
* wide range of distributions available

On the other hand, though, she also speaks to these disadvantages:

* it is more difficult to find applications that you need
* switching operating systems, the hardware may not be compatible with Linux as drivers are not commonly written for it
* it can be difficult to find support/help with the system
  * there are fees you must pay, whereas for other systems like Windows, it is free

Taking into account such advantages and disadvantages, when looking at the ["Global operating systems market share for desktop PCs, from January 2013 to July 2018"](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218089/global-market-share-of-windows-7/) graph, overtime, it can be seen that the marketshare for Linux has grown. This proves that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Because of this, in ["What is Linux?"](https://opensource.com/resources/linux) the author says:

>...between one- and two-thirds of the webpages on the Internet are generated by servers running Linux. Companies and individuals choose Linux for their servers because it is secure...

Along with this, within the community, Linux is used in many common devices, such as Android phones, cameras, video recorders, etc.
Similar to Windows and MacOS, Linux is made easier to use for such communities as it has a graphical user interface.
